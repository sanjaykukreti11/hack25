Imagine a company is using a marketing tool called Emarsys to communicate with its customers — for example, to send emails when certain things happen, like someone signing up or making a purchase.

Now, someone (probably a developer or marketing automation specialist) wants to manually trigger one of these events — say, a welcome email — for specific people. To do that, they send a message to Emarsys, telling it:

"Hey, please trigger this specific event (called {eventId}) right now for these contacts."

They include some extra details with this request:

A special key (key_id) that helps Emarsys know what kind of event this is.

A list of contacts — the people who should receive the message.

For each contact, they can include extra details, like:

An attachment (extra info related to the event),

A specific time the event is tied to,

A trigger ID and external ID to track the event properly.

Also, to make sure this request is allowed (and secure), they include a secret access token (like a password), so Emarsys knows it's coming from someone who has permission.

Once this message is sent, Emarsys acts on it — sending out the email or triggering whatever action is tied to that event, using the information provided.
