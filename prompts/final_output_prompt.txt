You will receive one or more JSON objects as input, possibly in raw or unstructured form. Your task is to return a single well-formatted JSON object containing each input JSON wrapped under a unique key such as "json1", "json2", "json3", and so on.

Rules:

The output must be a valid JSON object.

Each input JSON should be nested under its corresponding key ("json1", "json2", "json3", etc.).

Preserve the structure and content of each original JSON exactly.

Do not include any explanations, comments, or extra textâ€”only return the final JSON output.

{ "name": "Alice" }
{ "age": 30, "city": "New York" }

{
  "json1": {
    "name": "Alice"
  },
  "json2": {
    "age": 30,
    "city": "New York"
  }
}

Now, please return your output accordingly, just return only this, no extra text, character in the response. ```json ``` don't print/ return this as well, only proper json.
